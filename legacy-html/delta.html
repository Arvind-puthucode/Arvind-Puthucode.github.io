          <h2>February 18, 2026</h2>
          <p>
            I’m treating this as a working system, not a showcase. The goal is
            to write fast, publish fast, and make it easy to see the drift.
          </p>

          <h3>The Daily Flow (this is the habit)</h3>
          <p>This is the exact flow I follow every time I sit down to write.</p>

          <h3>Step 1: Capture (2–5 minutes)</h3>
          <p>Ask yourself:</p>
          <p>“What did I notice today?”</p>
          <p>“What confused me?”</p>
          <p>“What annoyed me?”</p>
          <p>“What idea keeps looping in my head?”</p>
          <p>Dump it raw. No formatting. No coherence required.</p>
          <p>If it’s:</p>
          <p>emotionally charged → Notes</p>
          <p>intellectually sharp → 1% Delta</p>

          <h3>Step 2: Choose the Mode (critical fork)</h3>
          <p><strong>Mode A: 1% Delta (most days)</strong></p>
          <p>Use this structure:</p>
          <p>Context: what triggered the thought</p>
          <p>Tension: what doesn’t make sense yet</p>
          <p>Current take: what you believe for now</p>
          <p>End with a sentence like:</p>
          <p>“This feels incomplete, but clearer than yesterday.”</p>
          <p>That sentence matters. It keeps ego out.</p>

          <p><strong>Mode B: Notes (when you’re foggy)</strong></p>
          <p>Just title it with a phrase and walk away.</p>
          <p>No conclusion. No pressure.</p>
          <p>Notes are not failure. They’re compost.</p>

          <h3>Step 3: Publish Immediately (non-negotiable)</h3>
          <p>No rereading more than once.</p>
          <p>No “I’ll clean this up later.”</p>
          <p>You’re training honesty + velocity, not prose.</p>
          <p>If you hesitate, ask:</p>
          <p>“Am I protecting clarity, or protecting ego?”</p>
          <p>Hit publish.</p>

          <h3>The Weekly Flow (20 minutes, once a week)</h3>
          <p>Once a week, skim what you wrote.</p>
          <p>Do one thing only:</p>
          <p>add a short line at the bottom of old posts:</p>
          <p>“Update: I don’t believe this anymore.”</p>
          <p>or “Still holds.”</p>
          <p>or “This aged badly.”</p>
          <p>Do not rewrite.</p>
          <p>Let the contradictions show. That’s the point.</p>

          <h3>The Monthly Flow (optional but powerful)</h3>
          <p>Create one synthesis post:</p>
          <p>“What I learned this month”</p>
          <p>“Ideas I changed my mind about”</p>
          <p>“Questions that got sharper”</p>
          <p>This is where readers see growth, not brilliance.</p>

          <h3>The Rulebook (print this mentally)</h3>
          <p>Write to understand, not to persuade</p>
          <p>Small thoughts &gt; rare big essays</p>
          <p>Embarrassment is a signal you’re being real</p>
          <p>Consistency beats insight density</p>
          <p>You’re building a mind archive, not a brand</p>

          <h3>What success actually looks like (important)</h3>
          <p>Success is not:</p>
          <p>traffic</p>
          <p>followers</p>
          <p>people agreeing with you</p>
          <p>Success is:</p>
          <p>you thinking faster</p>
          <p>you spotting your own bullshit sooner</p>
          <p>future-you being grateful this exists</p>
