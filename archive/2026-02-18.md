I'm treating this as a working system, not a showcase. The goal is to write fast, publish fast, and make it easy to see the drift.

## The Daily Flow (this is the habit)

This is the exact flow I follow every time I sit down to write.

## Step 1: Capture (2-5 minutes)

Ask yourself:

"What did I notice today?"

"What confused me?"

"What annoyed me?"

"What idea keeps looping in my head?"

Dump it raw. No formatting. No coherence required.

If it's:

emotionally charged -> Notes

intellectually sharp -> 1% Delta

## Step 2: Choose the Mode (critical fork)

**Mode A: 1% Delta (most days)**

Use this structure:

Context: what triggered the thought

Tension: what doesn't make sense yet

Current take: what you believe for now

End with a sentence like:

"This feels incomplete, but clearer than yesterday."

That sentence matters. It keeps ego out.

**Mode B: Notes (when you're foggy)**

Just title it with a phrase and walk away.

No conclusion. No pressure.

Notes are not failure. They're compost.

## Step 3: Publish Immediately (non-negotiable)

No rereading more than once.

No "I'll clean this up later."

You're training honesty + velocity, not prose.

If you hesitate, ask:

"Am I protecting clarity, or protecting ego?"

Hit publish.

## The Weekly Flow (20 minutes, once a week)

Once a week, skim what you wrote.

Do one thing only:

add a short line at the bottom of old posts:

"Update: I don't believe this anymore."

or "Still holds."

or "This aged badly."

Do not rewrite.

Let the contradictions show. That's the point.

## The Monthly Flow (optional but powerful)

Create one synthesis post:

"What I learned this month"

"Ideas I changed my mind about"

"Questions that got sharper"

This is where readers see growth, not brilliance.

## The Rulebook (print this mentally)

Write to understand, not to persuade

Small thoughts > rare big essays

Embarrassment is a signal you're being real

Consistency beats insight density

You're building a mind archive, not a brand

## What success actually looks like (important)

Success is not:

traffic

followers

people agreeing with you

Success is:

you thinking faster

you spotting your own bullshit sooner

future-you being grateful this exists
