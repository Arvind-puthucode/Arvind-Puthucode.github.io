    <p><strong>Thinking in public. One small delta at a time.</strong></p>
    <p>This site is a log of how my thinking evolves.</p>

    <p>
      I write here to turn vague intuitions into explicit models-about
      technology, systems, decision-making, and the world around them. Most
      posts are short. Many are unfinished. Some will be wrong.
    </p>
    <p>That's intentional.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>You'll find:</h2>
    <p>
      <a class="inline-link" href="/delta">1% Delta</a>
      - dated notes where I try to get slightly clearer than yesterday
    </p>
    <p>
      <a class="inline-link" href="/notes">Notes</a>
      - fragments, half-formed ideas, and things I don't yet understand
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="card">
    <p>Nothing here is optimized for polish or reach.</p>
    <p>Everything here is optimized for clarity and learning.</p>
    <p>Read it as a time series, not a manifesto.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>How to use this site</h2>
    <p>Start anywhere. Follow the dates. Watch ideas change.</p>
    <p>If something feels incomplete, it probably is. That's part of the process.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>A small rule</h2>
    <p>
      I don't edit old posts to look smarter in hindsight. If I change my mind,
      I write a new one.
