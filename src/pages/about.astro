    <p>Engineer - Data Scientist - Founder</p>

    <p>
      I was trained in computer science, but I'm more interested in how systems
      behave than in tools themselves.
    </p>

    <p>
      I hold a Master's degree in Theoretical Computer Science from PSG College
      of Technology. My formal background is in algorithms, stochastic
      processes, and reinforcement learning. That training still shapes how I
      think: probabilistically, structurally, and with a bias toward first
      principles.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've spent the last few years building production systems where scale and
      correctness matter. At Data Genie, I worked as a Data Scientist designing
      large-scale data pipelines, probabilistic metric frameworks, and
      aggregation-heavy systems, while working closely with clients to translate
      ambiguous business questions into concrete technical designs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Earlier, at KLA Tencor, I worked on data visualization systems for large
      datasets and learned what it means to build software that engineers rely
      on.
    </p>

    <p>
      More recently, I joined Lossfunk as a Startup Residency Fellow. That's
      where my focus shifted from how to build systems to which systems are
      worth building. My work there led from signal extraction experiments to
      what I'm currently building: ScoutFox, a web intelligence and
      signal-detection system focused on identifying what actually matters, not
      just what's visible.

    <h2>How I think</h2>
    <p>I care about:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>first principles over convention</li>
      <li>signal over noise</li>
      <li>leverage over busyness</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I'm comfortable being wrong in public if it helps me get clearer.</p>
